H5FS is a mountable Linux virtual file system that allows user to read the
content of HDF5 as if they were real files.

In fact, HDF5 simplifies the file structure to include only two major types of
object:

* Datasets, which are multidimensional arrays of a homogenous type

* Groups, which are container structures which can hold datasets and other
  groups

This results in a truly hierarchical, filesystem-like data format as resources
in an HDF5 file are even accessed using the POSIX-like syntax
/path/to/resource. By this way a virtual file system that exposes to the user
the hierarchical data seems natural.
